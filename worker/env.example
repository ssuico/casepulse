# ========================================
# MongoDB Connection (REQUIRED)
# ========================================
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/casepulse

# ========================================
# Encryption Key (REQUIRED)
# ========================================
# Used to decrypt account credentials from MongoDB
# MUST be the same key used by the main Next.js app
# Generate a secure random key with: node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js
# Minimum 32 characters
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-super-secret-encryption-key-min-32-chars-long-change-this

# ========================================
# Puppeteer Configuration (OPTIONAL)
# ========================================
# These can override database settings for testing purposes
# Leave empty to use settings from MongoDB (Puppeteer Configuration page)

# Set to true for headless mode (no browser window)
# Set to false to see the browser (useful for debugging)
HEADLESS=false

# Worker timeout in milliseconds (default: 180000 = 3 minutes)
TIMEOUT_MS=180000

# Seller Central URL (override for testing different regions)
# Leave commented to use setting from MongoDB
# SELLER_CENTRAL_URL=https://sellercentral.amazon.com/home

# ========================================
# Worker Trigger Parameters
# ========================================
# IMPORTANT: These are NOT credentials!
# They are IDENTIFIERS that tell the worker which data to fetch from MongoDB
#
# When triggered from the UI:
#   - The API automatically sets BRAND_ID
#   - The worker uses this ID to fetch the brand + account credentials from MongoDB
#
# For manual testing, set one of these:

# Option 1: Process a specific brand (most common)
BRAND_ID=

# Option 2: Process all brands under an account
ACCOUNT_ID=

# ========================================
# NOTE: All credentials are fetched from MongoDB
# ========================================
# The worker automatically retrieves:
# - Account credentials (username, password, 2FA key)
# - Brand details (brand name, URL)
# - Puppeteer settings (headless, timeout, Seller Central URL)
#
# No need to set these in .env anymore!
